### 🔹 SQL Analytics Project: Analyzing Energy Consumption across Distributions

**Overview**  
This project utilizes SQL to analyze customer energy consumption data, identifying cost patterns, regional disparities, and efficiency insights. The analysis utilizes aggregate queries, joins, calculated fields, and normalization metrics (cost per square meter and per occupant) to support data-driven energy efficiency strategies.

**Business Goal**
Analyze regional energy consumption patterns to identify cost efficiency, customer segmentation, and regional disparities.
